Subject: Resource temporarily unavailable error - Unable to execute commands in terminal

Hello,

I am facing a critical issue with my hosting and need your assistance.

🔴 Problem:
I cannot execute any commands in SSH terminal and receive the following error:
"bash: fork: retry: Resource temporarily unavailable"
"bash: fork: Resource temporarily unavailable"

This error occurs for all commands, even simple ones like:
- git fetch
- git pull
- pm2 restart
- pm2 status
- npm install
- and any other command that requires fork

📋 Technical Information:
- Host: CloudLinux (based on cagefs_enter error)
- Username: shop1111
- Project path: /home/shop1111/public_html/saded
- Node.js: /opt/alt/alt-nodejs20/root/usr/bin/node
- PM2: ~/.npm-global/bin/pm2
- Project: Next.js with PM2

🔧 What I've tried:
1. Deleted all .sh script files that had git fetch/pull commands
2. Used Cron Jobs to restart PM2 (but it didn't work)
3. Waited several hours but the problem persists
4. Tried to use cPanel File Manager

❓ My Requests:
1. Check LVE limits (PMEM, Process Limits, CPU)
2. Check running processes - Are there any extra Node.js or PM2 processes?
3. Kill extra processes (if any exist)
4. Restart PM2 for me (project name: saded)
5. Check if hosting limits are properly configured
6. If needed, increase LVE limits

📝 Additional Information:
- Project is running with PM2 (ecosystem.config.js)
- Everything was working fine before
- Problem started after running several git fetch/pull commands
- Now I cannot restart PM2 to apply new changes

⚠️ Urgent:
If possible, please restart PM2 for me:
/opt/alt/alt-nodejs20/root/usr/bin/node /home/shop1111/.npm-global/bin/pm2 restart saded --update-env

Thank you for your cooperation
